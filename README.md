# Python Design Patterns

The examples, with some code changes and brief explanations, 
are based on the book *"Mastering Python Design Patterns"*, Third Edition, 
writen by Kamon Ayeva and Sakis Kasampalis and published by *Packt Publishing* in 2024. 
They cover the most used and efficient design principles and patterns 
such as *SOLID*, *the Gang of Four (GoF)*, and many others in the context of Python programming.

## Motivation

*"Always remember - the best code is not just about making it work but also about making it work well. 
Even more, ideally, it should be easy to maintain."* - from the book.
