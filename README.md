# Python Design Patterns

The examples, with some code changes and brief explanations, 
are based on the book *"Mastering Python Design Patterns: 
Craft essential Python patterns by following core design principles"*, Third Edition, 
writen by Kamon Ayeva and Sakis Kasampalis and published by *Packt Publishing* in 2024. 
They cover the most used and efficient design principles and patterns in the context of Python programming
such as *SOLID*, *the Gang of Four (GoF)*, and many others.

Even more, ideally, it should be easy to maintain."* - from the book.
