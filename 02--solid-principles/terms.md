**SOLID = a set of five design principles proposed by Robert C. Martin**

- Single responsibility principle =
Each class should have one job or responsibility, 
and that job should be encapsulated within that class.

- Open-closed principle =
Software entities, such as classes and modules, should be open 
for extension (through inheritance or interfaces to accommodate 
new requirements and behaviors) but closed for modification.

- Liskov substitution principle = 
If a program uses objects of a superclass, then the substitution of them with objects
of a subclass should not change the correctness and expected behavior of the program.

- Interface segregation principle =
A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
In the context of Python, this implies that a class shouldn't be forced 
to inherit and implement methods that are irrelevant to its purpose.

- Dependency inversion principle
