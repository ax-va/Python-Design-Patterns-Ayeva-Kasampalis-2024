## Concurrency and Asynchronous Patterns

### Thread Pool

*Worker threads* are used to offload processing tasks from the main thread.
In the *Thread Pool* pattern, when one worker thread finishes a task, 
it does not terminate but goes back to the pool, 
awaiting another task that it can be used again for.

### Worker Model

### Future and Promise

### Observer (in Reactive Programming)
