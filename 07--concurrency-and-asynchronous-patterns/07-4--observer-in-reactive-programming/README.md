### Observer in Reactive Programming

To put it simply, the concept of *reactive programming* is
to react to many events (streams of events) while keeping the code clean,
This concept, added to the traditional Observer pattern,
creates the *Observer* pattern *in reactive programming*.

1. Run `observable_firstnames--reactivex.py`.
2. Add `Taylor Johns` to `fake_people.txt` (that is the stream source of data) and save the change.
3. The count of Taylor's will be increased in the terminal output after emitting the data.
