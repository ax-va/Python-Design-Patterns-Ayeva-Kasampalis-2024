# Patterns for testing
 
## Mock Objects

The *mock object* pattern is used to isolate components during testing by simulating their behavior with 
*mock objects* that help create controlled testing environments and verify interactions between components.

## Dependency injections

The *dependency injection* pattern involves passing the dependencies of a class as external entities 
rather than creating them within the class, which promotes loose coupling, modularity, and testability.
It is applicable not only in testing scenarios but also in general software design.
